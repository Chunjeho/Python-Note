## Why we use this?
To represent **n by n identity matrix**.

*Identity matrix is part of a linear algebra, and the linear algebra does **really** important role in data science, computer science etc.

## How to use it?
Use ``` numpy.identity(integer) ```

## Example
### ex1)
[IN 01]
```
import numpy as np

a = np.identity(5)
print(a)
```
[OUT 01]
```
[[1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]]
```
